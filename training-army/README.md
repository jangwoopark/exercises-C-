There are  wizards in the kingdom and they have the ability to transform the skill set of a person into another skill set. Each of the these wizards has two lists of skill sets associated with them,  and .

A person can go through multiple transformation of skill set.
Same class transformation is also possible. That is a person' skill set can be transformed into his current skill set. Eg.  in the above example.
Your goal is to design a series of transformation which results into maximum number of skill set with non-zero number of people knowing it.

Explanation

There are  types of skill sets present along with  wizards. Initially, all three people know the  skill set but no one knows the  and  skill sets.

The  wizard's initial lists are:  and . Suppose, he performs  transformation one any one of person with the  skill set, then it's list  will be updated to an empty list  and list  will be .
Now, we have two people knowing the  skill set and one person knowing the  skill set.

The  wizard's initial lists are:  and . He will use the transformation  one of the person with the  skill set, then it's lists will also be updated to an empty lists A:  and : .

Now, we have 1 person with  skillset and and 2 people knowing the  skillset.

The  wizard's initial lists are:  and . He will transform one of the person with  skillset to  one using the transformation . It's lists will also be updated to an empty lists A:  and : .
At this point, no further transformations are possible and we have achieved our maximum possible answer. Thus, each of the skill set, is known by  person.. This means there are three skill sets available in the kingdom.
