ADZEN is a popular advertising firm in your city that owns all  billboard locations on Main street. The city council passed a new zoning ordinance mandating that no more than  consecutive billboards may be up at any given time. For example, if there are  billboards on Main street and , ADZEN must remove either the middle billboard, the first two billboards, the last two billboards or the first and last billboard.

Being a for-profit company, ADZEN wants to lose as little advertising revenue as possible when removing the billboards. They want to comply with the new ordinance in such a way that the remaining billboards maximize their total revenues (i.e., the sum of revenues generated by the billboards left standing on Main street).

Given , , and the revenue of each of the  billboards, find and print the maximum profit that ADZEN can earn while complying with the zoning ordinance. Assume that Main street is a straight, contiguous block of  billboards that can be removed but cannot be reordered in any way.

For example, if there are  billboards, and  is the maximum number of consecutive billboards that can be active, with , then the maximum revenue that can be generated is : .
